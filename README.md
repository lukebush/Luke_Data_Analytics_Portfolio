Here is a SQL script analyzing a global health dataset (from WHO) through MySQL, applying data preparation, aggregation, and insight generation techniques.
It’s intended to illustrate my SQL skills in a structured, real-world–style pipeline: from raw data → cleaned schema → analytical queries → findings & interpretation.

Dataset & Context:
Source: World Health Organization / Global Health Observatory (life expectancy and related health/demographic indicators)
